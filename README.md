The SmallFry 40% Board
=====

## v0.8-v0.10
* I forget everything that I did, lots of little things
* fixed some unconnected pads (oops)
* cleaned up silkscreens again
* fixed diode pads to fit SOD-123 footprint
* fixed BOM info for components
* rounded PCB edges
* replaced slotted holes with... holes
* added Vcc and Gnd pins to LED expansion
* changed LED expansion pins to 2.54 pitch

## v0.7 - 2013.10.20
* cleaned up silkscreens
* moved 'ROW5' expansion to GPIO7 (still ATMEGA32U4 pin8/PB0)
* added notes
* cleaned up and removed extra libs/mods

## v0.6 - 2013.10.16
* pulled extra pin for ROW5 from ATMEGA pin 8/PB0
* changed drills for holes/slots to work with OSHpark 
* added GPIO4, GPIO5, GPIO6 connectors to ATMEGA pins 26/PD6, 22/PD5, 11/PB3
* ran row and GPIO to 1.27mm headers on right-side of board for interconnect (ribbon cable spacing)

 
## v0.5 - 2013.09.20
* added back missing slot on right side of board
* added LEDs for optional keys from v0.4
* generated pcb image * not sure why slots don't render properly
* removed bottom-of-board expansion pins

## v0.4 - 2013.09.19
* added optional 1.25+1.0 and 1.0+1.25 for right-shift/fn keys

## v0.3 - 2013.09.18
* based on the GH60 Rev B PCB
* SMT ATMEGA32U4 and other components on back of board
* Expansion ports on bottom and top row
* LEDs on ESC, 'CAPS', and WASD Cluster
* Other LEDs in matrix with expansion points on top row
